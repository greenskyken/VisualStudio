Time and Attendance - Data Sequence

One cardholder, one area, date range

Pull records for that door
	- select from door - where deviceid = <in door. or <out door>
	- order by date and time

Make sure the first record in an "IN" door
	- If not, delete record...index 0 from dataset

Make sure that the last record is an "OUT" door
	- If not, delete record....index last from dataset
	
Error checking:
- for x=0, x+2, x=rowcount-1
	- row (x).deviceID = in reader
	- row (x+1).deviceID = out reader
	- next
	
if this returns OK

Add colums to Dataset.table
- Move timeout to new column

Create new dataset - and tabel
- Add all existing columns
	- also add a column for out time
	- also add a column for elapsed

Copy records to new table
- will remove spaces

Calculate time difference to the nearest minute
- cast times to time
- subtract in from out
- dump this in the elapsed time column

Dump data to a DataGridView wiht the column headers
- total all elapsed time in the table and add a line to the bottom of the table.....Column 4 Total...column 5 is the number

Save to csv mechanism

Multiple cardholders, or multiple areas
- create two arrays
	- all cardholders in one
	- All areas in the other
	
- Cycle through each, adding them to the DataGridView
- Cardholder (0), Area (0)
- Cardholder (0), Area (1)
etc
then
Cardholder (1), area (0)
