For all in any category.....repeat for all

We now have the location, area, calendar framing and the badge

Create the query to pull only those records
- Sort by Date and Time
- Then look for multiples
	- cycle through each row, and compare the previous row DEVICE_ID to the current
		- If they are the same, delete the first entry
	- repeat for the remaining data
		- You want in, then out, then, in...etc
	
Confirm first entry is an IN reader
- Compare the area selected IN reader name to the first row

Confirm that the last is an OUT....same procedures

For X = 1 to rowcount
- Copy Date In, Time In, Date Out, Time Out, Area, Badge, Last First, Total Hours
	- If dates are the same, subtract 1 from 2
	- If out date is higher than in date, calculate in date till midnight, and midnight to out date

- Bottom of the page should tally that location, area, calendar range, and badge hours
